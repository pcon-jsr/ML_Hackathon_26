\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=8pt]
	\item You have to find \textbf{cheatcodes} that are hidden somewhere.
    
    \item If you find them, you can find very nice solutions!
    
    \item Based on this, you must submit the CSV files in the same format as before.
    
    \item If you find the right solution, you have to submit it in the \href{https://ayushjayaswal.xyz/mlhackathon}{same portal}.
    
    \item \textbf{Only change you must do is in your Registration Number:}
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item Change '\textbf{ug}' in your registration number with '\textbf{pg}'.
        \item Example: \texttt{2024\textcolor{red}{ug}ee067} becomes \texttt{2024\textcolor{red}{pg}ee067}
        \item Name and Submission Key remains the same.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item You will again get three chances for each problem with the new registration number.
    
    \item \textbf{Do NOT submit CTF solutions with the same Registration Number as the ML Solution.}
\end{itemize}
