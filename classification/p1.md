## Problem Description
Build a machine learning model to classify whether a team will at an event (1 for winner, 0 otherwise). Use creative feature engineering to uncover patterns in team dynamics, skills, etc. You may earn or loose _PCOINS_ based on predictions from your model.

## Dataset
You are provided with 50K entries from several events across colleges, including the following features:
- leetcode_hours (avg): Average hours spent on LeetCode.
- leetcode_problems (avg): Average problems solved on LeetCode.
- team_size: Number of team members.
- experience: Experience level (categorical: 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'expert').
- branch: Engineering branch (e.g., 'CSE', 'Mechanical').
- gaming_hours: Hours spent gaming.
- instagram_hours: Hours spent on Instagram.
- social_skill_points: Score for social skills.
- connections_among_seniors: Number of connections with seniors.
- connections_with_faculty: Number of connections with faculty.
- connections_among_juniors: Number of connections with juniors.
- have_freshman: Boolean if team has freshmen.
- all_freshman: Boolean if team is all freshmen.

Along with the target: whether they won or not (binary).

## Objectives
 Develop an good enough classifier (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or neural nets).

## Evaluation
Use eval.csv (it contains 10K entries with the above qualities). Submit your predictions as a single CSV file with 1001 lines: first line "output", then binary 0/1 predictions for each entry.

Your model must bet if a given team would win or loose the event. You'll recieve _PCOINS_ for every correct prediction and loose coins too on a wrong prediction as per following

True Positive +10
True Negative +8
False Positive -5
False Negative -4

Your score shall be the sum of all the _PCOINS_ you earn
