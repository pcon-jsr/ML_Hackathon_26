## Problem Description
Engineer a regression model to predict the number of participants attending tech fest events. Use creative feature engineering to uncover patterns in event appeal, logistics, and student behavior. Think: Does a famous guest boost turnout? How does weather or timing play a role?

## Dataset
You are provided with 50K entries from various tech fest events across colleges, including the following features:

- event_type: Event category
- guest: Guest speaker type
- organising_department: Hosting department (e.g., 'CSE', 'ECE', 'ME', 'MM', 'EE', 'CE', 'ECM', 'PIE').
- timing: Time of day ('Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening', 'Late Night').
- day_of_week: Day type ('Weekday', 'Weekend').
- promotion_level: Social media reach
- event_duration: Length in hours
- venue_capacity: Max capacity
- registration_fee: Cost in INR
- social_media_buzz: Mentions/shares 
- concurrent_events_count: Number of overlapping events (numerical).
- weather_condition: Weather ('Sunny', 'Cloudy', 'Rainy', 'Stormy').

Along with the target: recorded_participant_count (integer).

## Evaluation
Use eval.csv (it contains 10K entries with the above features). Submit your predictions as a single CSV file with 10K lines: predicted participant counts for each entry.

for each predicted value you shall be scored as follows:
```
tau = 0.1
e = np.abs(y - y_pred) / capacity
pcoins = 100 / (1 + (e / tau)**2)
```
Your final score for this problem shall be the sum of pcoins you earn from all your predictions
